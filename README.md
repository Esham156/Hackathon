# Bugs

- had issues with superhero Api so switched to pokemon Api - some function, folders are still using the superhero naming convention
- not much in the way of error handling so type in pokemon names correctly
- useEffect hook runs 2 times when you first enter the pokemon page and when you search a pokemon.
- if you try to add a pokemon to your pokedex when it is already present there, it displays "No Pok√©mon found!"
